Title: Optimal Microbiome-based Association Test (OMiAT)
Author: Hyunwook Koh
Maintainer: Hyunwook Koh <hyunwook.koh@stonybrook.edu>
Description: This software package provides facilities for 1) optimal microbiome-based association test (OMiAT) which tests the association between the entire community (e.g., kingdom) or indivisual upper-level taxa (e.g., phylum, class, order, family, genus) and a host phenotype of interest (or disease status). 2) microbiome comprehensive association mapping (MiCAM) which tests the association for all microbial taxa through a breadth of taxonomic levels. Continuous/binary responses (e.g., BMI, disease status) can be surveyed with/without covariate adjustments (e.g., age, gender).
